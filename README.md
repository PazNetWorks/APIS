# PazNetworks-APIs Project

Welcome to the PazNetworks-APIs repository! This repository is structured to manage and maintain FastAPI projects for our clients in an organized, scalable manner. Below you'll find instructions on how to add new clients to this structure.

## Adding New Clients

When onboarding a new client or starting a new project, follow these steps to create a dedicated project space within this repository:

1. **Create the Client's Directory Structure**

   Replace `client_x` with your new client's name or identifier:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p client_x/app/routers client_x/app/models client_x/tests
   ```

2. **Create Essential Files**

   Navigate to the new client's directory and set up the initial files:

   ```sh
   cd client_x
   touch app/main.py app/dependencies.py Dockerfile requirements.txt
   cd ../  # Go back to the root directory
   ```

3. **Initialize Basic Application**

   Add a simple FastAPI application in `main.py`. Here's a template to get started:

   ```python
   # client_x/app/main.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"Hello": "from Client X"}
   ```

   Update the `requirements.txt` with the necessary dependencies. At a minimum, you'll need `fastapi` and `uvicorn`:

   ```plaintext
   # client_x/requirements.txt
   fastapi
   uvicorn[standard]
   ```

4. **Add a Dockerfile**

   For containerization, set up a Dockerfile:

   ```Dockerfile
   # client_x/Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY ./client_x/requirements.txt requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   COPY ./client_x/app /app
   CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
   ```

5. **Update the Repository Documentation**

   Ensure that any specific setup or configurations needed for the new client are documented, either at the root `README.md` or a client-specific `README.md` within the client's directory.

6. **Commit Your Changes**

   Don't forget to add, commit, and push your changes to the repository:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new client: Client X"
   git push
   ```

Following these steps will ensure that each client project is set up consistently, making it easier to manage and scale our API development efforts. For specific details on development workflows, testing, and deployment, refer to the subsequent sections of this document.
